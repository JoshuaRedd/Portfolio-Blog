			<h1><a href="#top">Designing a Milkshake-Vending-Machine (MSVM) Interface</a></h1>
			<h2>The Perfect Blend</h2>

			<time datetime="18-01-2020">Jan 18, 2020</time>
			<p>
				<strong>You asked. I delivered.</strong> <br> Okay.. maybe just my CMPT 381
				asked, but who can say no to dessert? Even if it is in the form of a user interface design project.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this post I walk through the process of designing a user interface
				for a milkshake vending machine (MSVM) utilizing <strong>user personas, interface sketches, and design walkthroughs.</strong>
				By the end of this process a winner will emerge which I will attempt to bring to life using Javafx.
			</p>
			<p>
				Below is a portion of the initial assignment brief:

			<h3>USER PERSONAS</h3>
			<p>
				Personas are fictional characters that aggregate patterns and trends in a given user group. They can
				be a very useful point of focus and, from what I've experienced so far, a great opportunity to integrate
				user empathy into the design process. The Interaction Design Foundation provides a large wealth of free
				resources, check out their introduction to personas <a id="red" href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/personas-why-and-how-you-should-use-them" target="_blank">here!</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				For this assignment I was provided with 2 user personas and tasked with creating a third. In real life projects
				user personas should be created as a direct refleciton of research and data, when the interface designer or team creates
				personas without research they are referred to as "Fictional Personas." Using Fictional Personas as a guide for design
				and development is bad practice but this is what we will be working with for the sake of this assignment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Scroll down to see the two provided personas alongside my creation: Jeff. To polish things up a bit I created Jeffs Persona
				with Adobe XD.

			<h3>TASK DESCRIPTIONS</h3>
			<p>
				With personas generated I can look at specific tasks each user would attempt to carry out within
				the overarching goal of ordering milkshake(s).

			<h3>INTERFACE SKETCHES</H3>
				<p>
					With personas in hand and realistic tasks established I'm ready to get down to sketching Interface ideas.
					The object here is to generate many ideas quickly, or as my prof put it "to fail fast and fail early."
					Physical paper is a great medium for this task as it's quick, easy, and (if you recycle) relatively painless!
				</p>
				<p>
					Once again the folks at the Interactive Design Foundation have <a id="red" href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/etch-a-sketch-how-to-use-sketching-in-user-experience-design" target="_blank">
						a great article on this topic!</a>
				</p>
				<h4>MSVM Sketches</h4>

			<h3>User Walkthroughs</h3>
			<p>
				After sketching out several ideas and picking the best ones it's time to test them out with user
				walkthroughs. Prototyping applicaitons like Adobe XD are very powerful in their capacity to animate
				and provide a realistic experience to test designs with; this is great but paper modals can work
				brilliantly too.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ideally a designer would recruit others to play the roles laid out in the persona and
				make note of any pain points throughout the interaction. In this instance I had to stand in
				as the user and see what I could gleam by shifting my perspective.
			</p>
			<p>
				Walkthroughs were performed for all 3 users with all 3 selected interfaces for a total of 9. Below
				I have shared just the walkthroughs for Marlon:

			<h3>Final Selection & Design Rational</h3>
			<p>
				Options are great, but to move forward it's important to identify a design that best resovles the original
				design problem and user goals. I also don't want to forget about all of those tasty nuggets of information
				and revealed pain points from the walkthroughs. Identifying how to remedy these problems and putting those
				changes into action for the next iteration rounds off the process nicely.
			</p>

				Huzzah for empathy driven design! Until next time.

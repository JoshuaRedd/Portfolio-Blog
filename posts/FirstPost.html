			<h1><a href="#top">Creating this website</a></h1>
			<h2>The process</h2>

				seems to be an industry truism at this point. The fast pace of web development is exciting but as a beginner, I also found it daunting, where does one start?
				In this post, I document the path I took in learning to build this webpage and some tools I found helpful along the way. <br>
				<br>
				It took me time to <strong>overcome the notion that one needs to know everything to arrive at competence.</strong>
				I had a lot of fun working through the technical aspects of building this page, I also learned the value of accepting that uncomfortable
				feeling of not knowing all the answers and searching them out.

				Ugh, while I get down from my matchbox please buckle up your... coding pants? Because we're about to get started!

			<h3>STARTING WITH THE BASICS</h3>
				<figure class="size-1">
					<img src=https://skywell.software/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/javascript-vs-html-vs-css-1024x683.jpg>
				</figure>

				<p>HTML, CSS, and JS, are the building blocks for the web and the perfect place to start as a beginner. It times I've found
				kindness to be preferncial to honesty.. with that said these are the only 3 acronyms you'll need to worry about.  </p>

				<h4>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</h4>

				<p>This is where the basic structural components of a web page are laid out including paragraphs p, headers h1, h2, h3, and the trusty div for division. </p>

				<h4>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h4>

				<p>CSS is concerned mainly with the aesthetic styling of your webpage. This is where you will define the layout of items on a page sit and how they look.
					 Fonts, colours, positioning; it all happens here.</p>

				<h4>JS - JavaScript </h4>

				<p>Unlike HTML and CSS, which are both Markup Languages, JavaScript is a programming language.
					Don't worry if this doesn't mean anything to you yet. For now, it's important to know that this is where functionality and interactivity are added to the web page.
					You may not know it but you already use javascript every day. Adding items into an online shopping cart on or "liking" your friends post on
					social media are both common tasks accomplished by programming languages such as JavaScript.</p>

				<h4> Resources </h4>

				<p>There are many great options when it comes to learning these basic languages. I've been using <a href=http://freecodecamp.org target="_blank">freecodecamp</a>.
					As the name suggests it's completely free! It's also easy to follow, appropriate in depth, and provides certificiates for sections completed.
					Once you start building your own webpages you will also need a text editor fit for the job. I've really enjoyed using <a href=https://atom.io/ target="_blank">atom</a>.
					It's clean, free, and easy to get started with.</p>

			<h3>DESIGN FORWARD DEVELOPMENT</h3>
				<p>
					Each of these design aspects is enough for many blog posts, below are a few resources to get you started.
				</p>

				<h4> Typography </h4>
				<p>
					When it comes to type the sky really is the limit. Look <a href=https://medium.com/gravitdesigner/typography-elements-everyone-needs-to-understand-5fdea82f470d
					target="_blank">here</a> for a quick look at the basics of typography. <br>
					<strong>Free fonts</strong> - <a href=https://fonts.google.com/ target="_blank">Google fonts</a> <br>
					<strong>Included with Creative Cloud</strong> - <a href=https://fonts.adobe.com/ target="_blank">Adobe fonts</a>
				</p>

				<h4> Colour </h4>
				<p>
					Once again there is too much to say for even one blog post.
					<a href=https://medium.com/gravitdesigner/an-easy-approach-to-color-theory-and-graphic-design-8b9287c95e42 target="_blank">
					This article</a>
					is graphic design oriented but I've found it to be a helpful and consice.
					Ready to play around? <br>
					<strong>Try</strong> - <a href=https://color.adobe.com/create target="_blank">Adobe color</a>
				</p>

				<h4> Design Thinking </h4>

				<figure class="size-1">
					<img src=https://www.hallaminternet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/double-diamond.png>
				</figure>

					<p>Typography and colour are a lot of fun, but good design is comprised of so much more than visuals. Design thinking,
					put simply, is solution based problem solving often heavily influenced by understanding human users.
					If you're interested in learning more <a href=https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-design-thinking-and-why-is-it-so-popular target="_blank"> this</a>
					is a great introductory article! </p>

			<h3>FEATURES SPECIFIC TO THIS BLOG</h3>
			<p>
				The folks over at Freecodecamp released <a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-design-and-develop-a-beautiful-blog-from-scratch-a0cd1af46845/ target="_blank"> this tutorial</a>
				on building a blog post that I found immensely helpful. It introduces 2 very powerful CSS layout techniques, flexbox and grid, that are especially useful for responsive design (mobile friendly websites).
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're curious about the fading banner at the top of this post I've documented the code for it over on <a href=https://codepen.io/Joshuared/pen/VwYrNor target="_blank"> CodePen</a>.
				It utilizes a very popular JavaScript library known as jQuery ([https://jquery.com/](https://jquery.com/)) to modify the transparency of the image based on the users scrolling.
			</p>
			<h3>WHAT'S NEXT?</h3>
			<p>
				Great question kind reader! <br>
				Putting this together was far more fun than I expected it to be.
				They say the best way to learn is by teaching and the second to best is by doing.
				With that in mind I'm excited to keep this page going as I continue to explore topics related to development, art, psychology, and design.
			</p>
			<h4> Looking to future updates I would like to: </h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Explore accessibility and document the process of brining this website from 0 to hero in this regard.</li>
				<li>Utilize JavaScript to add a database of sorts for blog posts that is sortable by type and highly interactive.</li>
				<li>Continued stylistic and functional refinements as I work through Freecodecamps curriculum.</li>
				<li>Add a comment section to blog posts. Google profile integration?</li>
				<li>Write a blog post about all the meaningless symbols I've been photographing out in the wild world of public infrastructure.</li>
				<li>and the list goes on!</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="nospace">
				I hope you found this article informative and enjoyable. Constructive feedback is always welcome, feel free to get in touch
				with me using one of the channels listed below, and until then, happy developing!

				seems to be an industry truism at this point. The especially fast pace of web development is exciting, but it can also be daunting

			<h3>STARTING WITH THE BASICS</h3>
				<p>Frameworks, code editors, version control, and endless add ons; it was overwhelming at first. Once I
					narrowed my focus down I was able to gain some traction. It also took me time to <strong>overcome the notion
					that one needs to know everything to arrive at competence.</strong>

					html, css, javascript

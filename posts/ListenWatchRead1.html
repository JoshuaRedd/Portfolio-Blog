				I consume an alarming amount of media; more than I care to admit. In an effort that can only be described as selfless heroism,
				I have decided to curate some of my favorite pieces; both new and old.

			<h3>LISTEN | The Calendar (99% Invisible)</h3>
			<p>
				This podcast episode is a equal parts fascinating and torture. I don't know why I'm so drawn to design that is ripe for
				improvements that are unlikely to ever be implemented. It could be that I find solace in the flaws of design.
				Knowing perfection is a destination we will never fully arrive at helps me ease up on my own perfectionism.
				Or maybe I just like to daydream! In this episode of 99% invisible host, Ben Brock Johnson, explores <strong>the serious design flaws
				of our current calendar, </strong> it's origin, vastly improved versions, and <strong>why they will never be realized.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Below is one of my favorite candidates to replace the Gregorian calendar we currently use. Fun fact, it was adopted
				by film/camera company Kodak for a number of years!

				"A month is hardly a unit of measurement. It can start on any day of the week and last anywhere from 28 to 31 days.
				Sometimes a month is four weeks long, sometimes five, sometimes six. You have to buy a new calendar with new dates every
				single year. It’s a strange design."

			<h3>WATCH | Abstract - The Art of Design (Paula Scher)</h3>
			<p>
				I'm glad Netflix chose to publish this episode of the Abstract series on YouTube. Paula Scher is a graphic design master with an emphasis on utilizing typography as "painting with words.
				 That's my biggest high. It's my crack!"
			</p>
			<p class="nospace">
				She's done a lot. From vinyl covers:

				Paula is part of "the worlds largest independently-owned design studio:" <a id="red" href="https://www.pentagram.com/about" target="_blank">Pentagram.</a>
				She also has a body of "nonsensicle artistic works" that I find both amusing and intriguing. Ah, I could geek out ad nauseam,
				I'll relent. Find the full episode below!

				This will be old news for some of you, if it isn't: buckle up and prepare for.. better wifi?

				Attempting to find a corner of the earth free of internet connectivity may soon become a great degree more difficult.
				Love him or hate him, <strong>Elon Musk is really pushing the envelope.</strong> SpaceX is launching 60 satellites at a time aboard it's
				Falcon 9 rockets, which are then positioned neatly 550km above the earths surface to beam down memes and TikToks
				(among other things) to all surface dwellers below.

				Of course there are a myriad of unintended consequences that come with adding 1000+ satellites into the earths low orbit.
				Astronomers have been especially vocal about the obstruction Starlink satellites cause to observatories and casual stargazers
				alike.
			</p>
			<p>
				Witnessing a string of these satellites drifting across the night sky helps add credence to concerns of light pollution and obstruction:

			<p>
				SpaceX has committed to painting the satellites with an anti-reflective coating in response. Concerns about reflectivity are good and well, but I'm more interested in <strong> the implications of a constantly (and inescapably) connected world.</strong> The last 20 years have seen a major shift in human connectivity. There is a part of me that will long for the experience of hiking backcountry without even the sliver of a chance at receiving emails. Another perspective brings excitement at the possibility of <strong>remote work becoming accessible just about anywhere and to anyone.</strong> Global internet also has huge potential implications for <strong>delivery of education and activation of emergency services.</strong> To throw another wrench into the whole discussion, how will communist dictatorships deal with the implications of a globally accessible internet?
			</p>
			<p>
				As per usual, I'm all speculation and no answers. But, I'm excited to see how the world will navigate these advancements.

				Thanks for tuning in. Hopefully this will be a recurring segment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Until then, stay positive and stay safe.
